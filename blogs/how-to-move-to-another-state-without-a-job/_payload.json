You&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember which box is which,&rdquo; but label every box with the room it goes to and a brief description of its contents.

It&rsquo;ll save you so much time later when you start unpacking.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Check Utilities Again\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Make sure everything is up and running: lights, water, heating, etc. If anything&rsquo;s off, call the utilities to get it fixed ASAP.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Start Unpacking Your Essentials Box\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Finally, crack open your moving day essentials box.

Follow these steps and learn how to pack fragile items.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Prepare Your Items\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Clean Them First\u003C/strong>: Before you wrap up anything, give it a quick clean. Dust and dirt can cause scratches; we're not about that life.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Disassemble If Possible\u003C/strong>: If there&rsquo;s a way to take things apart (like legs off \u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"https://goodview-moving.com/services/furniture-assembly-and-disassembly-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">furniture\u003C/a>\u003C/strong> or removable pieces of a lamp), do it. It&rsquo;ll make packing a whole lot easier and save you space.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Wrap them Up\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Use Bubble Wrap\u003C/strong>: Start by wrapping each item in several layers of bubble wrap. If it&rsquo;s something super fragile, like a vase or glass, go extra here. Make sure every corner is covered!\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Tape It Down\u003C/strong>: Secure the wrap in place using packing tape. Don't be shy with the tape&mdash;you want that bubble wrap to stay put.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Choose the Right Box\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Pick the Right Size Box\u003C/strong>: Don't try to cram everything into one box. Your fragile items should fit snugly but with enough room for padding.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Use Cushioning\u003C/strong>: Start by adding a layer of packing peanuts or crumpled packing paper to the bottom. This helps absorb any shock if the box gets dropped or bumped.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Put Your Stuff in the Box\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Center the Item\u003C/strong>: Place your wrapped item in the center of the box. This is like giving your item a comfy bed. No side of the box should touch the fragile item.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Fill Any Gaps\u003C/strong>: Fill any extra space around the item with more packing peanuts or crumpled paper to keep it from shifting. You don&rsquo;t want your stuff moving around in there.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Seal It and Label It\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Tape the Box Securely\u003C/strong>: Seal all edges with plenty of packing tape. You don&rsquo;t want your box bursting open during the move.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Label It Clearly\u003C/strong>: This is where those fragile stickers come in handy. Slap a \"Fragile\" sticker on all sides of the box so anyone handling it knows to be extra careful. You can even mark \"This Side Up\" so your items stay upright.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch2>Packing Fragile Items for Shipping\u003C/h2>\r\n\u003Cp>If you are shipping fragile stuff, then you need to take extra precautions.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Double Box It\u003C/strong>: Place your fragile item in a smaller box, then put that box in a bigger box filled with packing peanuts or bubble wrap. This will give the item extra protection.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Insure It\u003C/strong>: You'll want to insure valuable items. It is better to be safe than sorry.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Use Reliable Shipping Companies\u003C/strong>: Go for well-known shipping companies that handle fragile items with care.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch2>Packing Fragile Items for Storage\u003C/h2>\r\n\u003Cp>If you&rsquo;re storing fragile items for a while, don&rsquo;t just toss them in a corner and hope for the best.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Here&rsquo;s how to pack fragile items for \u003Ca href=\"https://goodview-moving.com/services/storage-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u003Cstrong>storage\u003C/strong>\u003C/a>:\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Climate Control Is Key\u003C/strong>: Temperature changes and humidity can damage fragile items, so always store them in a climate-controlled space.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Don&rsquo;t Stack Heavy Things\u003C/strong>: Don&rsquo;t put heavy boxes on top of your fragile ones. They&rsquo;ll crush everything beneath them.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Check Periodically\u003C/strong>: If you&rsquo;re storing stuff long-term, check on it every few months to make sure everything&rsquo;s still in good shape.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch2>Packing Fragile Items for International Shipping\u003C/h2>\r\n\u003Cp>If you are packing fragile items for international shipping, that&rsquo;s a whole different thing.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Check the Regulations\u003C/strong>: Every country has different shipping rules. Look up the import regulations before you send anything.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Use the Right Materials\u003C/strong>: International shipments must go through customs, so make sure your packing materials comply with the rules of the destination country.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Expect Delays\u003C/strong>: Shipping across borders can take time, so pack everything as securely as possible to withstand the long journey.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch2>Tips for Packing Fragile Items\u003C/h2>\r\n\u003Cp>When it comes to packing fragile items, you can't afford to cut corners.

Bubble wrap and foam sheets are the way to go. They provide the right amount of cushioning and shock absorption.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Overpack\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>When it comes to fragile items, you can never have too much padding. It's always better to overpack than to risk not having enough protection. If you&rsquo;re unsure, add a little extra bubble wrap or packing paper.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Don&rsquo;t Forget to Label\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>You&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just tell the movers to be careful.&rdquo; But labeling your boxes with clear &ldquo;fragile&rdquo; and &ldquo;this side up&rdquo; stickers or markings makes sure that everyone handling your items knows they need to treat them gently.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Choose the Right Box Size\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Choosing a box that&rsquo;s too small can make it hard to add enough padding, while a box that&rsquo;s too large can let your items shift around inside. Pick a box that fits your fragile items snugly, leaving just enough space for cushioning.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Use Cushioning Between Items\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>When packing multiple fragile items in one box, make sure there&rsquo;s enough cushioning between each item. This prevents them from banging into each other during transport.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Wrap and Pack Items Individually\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Never pack fragile items together without wrapping them individually.

The key to making your move as smooth as possible is finding a reputable moving company that you can trust.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>But just because a company claims to be \"reputable\" doesn't mean they actually are.&nbsp;\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Finding the best moving companies that won&rsquo;t break the bank or leave your stuff in a ditch is where the magic happens.&nbsp;\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>In fact, a recent survey found that 35% of people regret not researching their moving company enough.&nbsp;\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>So, what should you be doing to find a reputable moving company?&nbsp;\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Let&rsquo;s get into how you can weed out the bad apples and find the moving company that&rsquo;ll actually show up and make your move feel like a breeze.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch2>Start by Doing Your Research\u003C/h2>\r\n\u003Cp>Before you get too carried away, grab your phone, sit down and get online.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Search for the best moving companies in your area.
