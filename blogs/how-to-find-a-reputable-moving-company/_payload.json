That&rsquo;s a risky business.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>One of the biggest mistakes to avoid when moving is \u003Ca href=\"https://goodview-moving.com/blogs/how-to-find-a-reputable-moving-company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u003Cstrong>hiring a company\u003C/strong>\u003C/a> without checking its reviews, insurance, or credentials.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Look for verified licenses, solid reviews, and clear pricing.

Just because you start packing early doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re doing it right.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>This is where many moving mistakes happen. Let&rsquo;s break down the biggest packing mistakes and how to avoid them.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Packing too late or too early\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Timing your packing is a balancing act.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Start too late, and you&rsquo;ll end up panic-packing&mdash;tossing things in boxes without a clue where anything is. Start too early, and you&rsquo;ll reopen sealed boxes for your phone charger or frying pan.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>The solution?\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Pack in waves. Begin with things you rarely use, like seasonal decor or spare linens. Save everyday essentials for last.

Not quite.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Reusing worn-out boxes or wrapping your glasses in T-shirts might seem efficient, but it often results in damage.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>If you&rsquo;re serious about avoiding damage during a move, use the right supplies: sturdy boxes, packing paper, bubble wrap, and high-quality tape.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Not labeling boxes properly\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>It might seem like a no-brainer, but you&rsquo;d be surprised how many people skip this step.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Unlabeled boxes lead to chaos when it&rsquo;s time to unpack.

The result? Torn boxes, crushed contents, or injured backs.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>One key home moving tip is to keep boxes manageable. Use smaller boxes for heavy items, such as books, and save the larger ones for lighter items, like bedding or clothes.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch2>Mistakes on Moving Day\u003C/h2>\r\n\u003Cp>So, you've planned everything and packed like a pro&mdash;nice work. But even the most organized move can unravel if the moving day itself goes off-script.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>This is where the pressure peaks, and without the right game plan, it&rsquo;s easy to make split-second decisions that lead to delays, confusion, or damage.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Here are the most common moving mistakes people make on the big day&mdash;and how to stay one step ahead.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Lack of coordination\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>You don&rsquo;t want everyone asking, &ldquo;What should I be doing right now?&rdquo; at 8 a.m. on moving day.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Without a clear plan, tasks get repeated or missed entirely.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Create a basic schedule and assign roles&mdash;who manages the movers, who checks off the moving checklist, and who makes sure nothing gets left behind.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Forgetting essentials or important documents\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp class=\"MsoNormal\">On a day full of boxes, tape, and heavy lifting, the small stuff is easy to forget&mdash;but often the most important.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp class=\"MsoNormal\">Set aside a bag or small box with essentials, including keys, phone charger, medications, wallet, and important paperwork such as lease agreements or moving company contracts.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Not having these handy can slow things down and raise your moving day stress.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Ignoring weather conditions\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Weather is one of those things we can&rsquo;t control, but we can prepare for it. Rain, snow, or extreme heat can make loading and unloading much harder (and riskier).\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Have tarps, towels, or plastic wrap ready to protect your stuff. And don&rsquo;t forget to dress appropriately; being uncomfortable makes the whole process feel ten times worse.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Even a quick check of the forecast can save your day.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Not doing a final walkthrough\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>You&rsquo;d be surprised how many people close the door on their old place... and leave half a closet behind.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Before heading out, do one last walkthrough.

More boxes, higher costs, and more stuff to unpack later.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Take time to declutter before you start packing. Donate, sell, or toss anything you haven&rsquo;t used in the past year. Not only will this lighten your load, but it&rsquo;ll also make your new place feel more organized from day one.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Not notifying relevant parties\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>In the chaos of packing and planning, it's easy to forget to update your address.

You need sturdy boxes, bubble wrap, packing paper, markers for labeling, and maybe some mattress bags. You can usually find cheap or free boxes at grocery stores or Craigslist.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Step 5: Start Packing (But Pack Smart)\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Begin with stuff you don't use daily&mdash;holiday decorations, books, out-of-season clothes.

Forgetting this is the quickest way to miss your important bills or cards.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Step 7: Prepare for the Big Day\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Arrange for movers or rent your truck.

If you have kids or pets, keep them occupied away from the chaos. Seriously, there are a lot of moving parts, and you need to stay on top.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Step 3: Double-Check Your Old Place\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Before the movers shut the door for the last time, do a sweep. Check closets, cabinets, and under beds. You don't want to be that person who has to drive back to find the missing blender.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Step 4: Protect Your Valuables\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Keep jewelry, cash, passports, and anything super valuable with you. Movers are pros, but better safe than sorry.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Step 5: Keep Your Cool\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Moving day is a rollercoaster. There will be hiccups&mdash;maybe a box breaks or traffic slows your truck&mdash;but keep your sense of humor. You&rsquo;re making memories, even if some of them involve bubble wrap disasters.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Step 6: Unpack Smart\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Once you get to your new place, don&rsquo;t go wild unpacking everything at once. Unpack the essentials box first (remember that one?). Then, tackle rooms one by one so it&rsquo;s manageable.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch2>After the Move\u003C/h2>\r\n\u003Cp>You survived the madness and are officially in your new home.

No one wants to move into a dark, internet-less cave.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Step 2: Change Your Locks\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>For peace of mind, changing the locks or rekeying is a smart move. You never know who might still have a key to your new place.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Step 3: Register Your Address\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Remember to update your driver's license, car registration, and voter registration. It's the boring stuff, but it's important.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Step 4: Introduce Yourself to the Neighborhood\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Go say hi to your neighbors, find the nearest grocery store, and scope out local hangouts. Feeling at home is about more than just unpacking boxes.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Step 5: Organize and Clean as You Go\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Unpack, yes, but also clean. It's easier to clean before everything is in place, and you'll feel less overwhelmed if your new place isn't a mess.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Step 6: Take Care of Your Pets and Plants\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>If you have furry friends or green babies, help them adjust by keeping their routines and ensuring their needs are met.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Step 7: Relax and Celebrate\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>You did it!

The key to making your move as smooth as possible is finding a reputable moving company that you can trust.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>But just because a company claims to be \"reputable\" doesn't mean they actually are.&nbsp;\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Finding the best moving companies that won&rsquo;t break the bank or leave your stuff in a ditch is where the magic happens.&nbsp;\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>In fact, a recent survey found that 35% of people regret not researching their moving company enough.&nbsp;\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>So, what should you be doing to find a reputable moving company?&nbsp;\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Let&rsquo;s get into how you can weed out the bad apples and find the moving company that&rsquo;ll actually show up and make your move feel like a breeze.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch2>Start by Doing Your Research\u003C/h2>\r\n\u003Cp>Before you get too carried away, grab your phone, sit down and get online.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Search for the best moving companies in your area. Check Google to see what people are saying.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>We can&rsquo;t stress this enough: moving company reviews are EVERYTHING. Look for companies with positive ratings across multiple platforms.&nbsp;\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Pay attention to the consistency of reviews. If a company has 4.5 stars on Yelp and 3 stars on Google, maybe dig a little deeper to figure out why.&nbsp;\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>You want those glowing reviews that scream, \"These guys are the real deal!\"\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>And while you're at it, check out their website. If it looks sketchy or like it was made in 1997, that&rsquo;s a red flag.&nbsp;\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>A\u003Ca href=\"https://goodview-moving.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> \u003Cstrong>reputable company\u003C/strong> \u003C/a>will have a clean, professional website that makes it easy for you to find info, request a quote, and contact them.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch2>Make Sure They&rsquo;re Licensed and Insured\u003C/h2>\r\n\u003Cp>You wouldn&rsquo;t hire a handyman who doesn&rsquo;t have a license.
