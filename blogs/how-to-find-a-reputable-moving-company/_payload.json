Dust and dirt can cause scratches; we're not about that life.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Disassemble If Possible\u003C/strong>: If there&rsquo;s a way to take things apart (like legs off furniture or removable pieces of a lamp), do it.

Bubble wrap and foam sheets are the way to go. They provide the right amount of cushioning and shock absorption.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch2>Overpack\u003C/h2>\r\n\u003Cp>When it comes to fragile items, you can never have too much padding. It's always better to overpack than to risk not having enough protection. If you&rsquo;re unsure, add a little extra bubble wrap or packing paper.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Don&rsquo;t Forget to Label\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>You&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just tell the movers to be careful.&rdquo; But labeling your boxes with clear &ldquo;fragile&rdquo; and &ldquo;this side up&rdquo; stickers or markings makes sure that everyone handling your items knows they need to treat them gently.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Choose the Right Box Size\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Choosing a box that&rsquo;s too small can make it hard to add enough padding, while a box that&rsquo;s too large can let your items shift around inside. Pick a box that fits your fragile items snugly, leaving just enough space for cushioning.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Use Cushioning Between Items\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>When packing multiple fragile items in one box, make sure there&rsquo;s enough cushioning between each item. This prevents them from banging into each other during transport.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Ch3>Wrap and Pack Items Individually\u003C/h3>\r\n\u003Cp>Never pack fragile items together without wrapping them individually. Each item should have its own layer of protection, whether it&rsquo;s bubble wrap or packing paper.\u003C/p>",false,"07 May 2025",true,"2025-05-07T05:39:31.000000Z","2025-05-07T05:44:02.000000Z",null,{"id":8,"name":20,"slug":21,"description":20,"created_at":22,"updated_at":22},"moving guide","moving-guide","2025-04-19T12:06:25.000000Z",[24],{"id":25,"title":26,"description":27,"keywords":6,"blog_id":5,"created_at":28,"updated_at":28},130,"How to Pack Fragile Items - Tips for Safe Moving","Learn how to pack fragile items safely for moving with expert tips.
